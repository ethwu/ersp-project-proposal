# Challenging part of the research / problem - suggested by prof. Mirza

we need to talk about the expected challenges and why it would be difficult to work on.

# Specific problem - suggested by prof. Mirza

we need to research on relate works
we need to use these works to prove why our research is trying to answer a OPEN question

# Flow of sentences

try to make the flow of the sentence nicer and less hard to parse

# Mostly descriptive in the intro

reads more like description instead of motivating the problem; try to motivate the problem more. The fact that you're collecting data from the UCSB border router comes out of the blue. Why are you doing that?

# QoE and QoS

Talk about how QoE is hard to measure earlier in the research paper

# What is the problem?

Doesn't come out clearly in the intro but is kind of spread out later <- put it earlier in the intro. Raw data to predict the QoE, which is hard to measure, so that we can eventually create smart routing rules

# What makes using the UCSB network interesting?

Mention that it's real world and how we can create a model that generalizes better to real-world networks <- write it earlier and in a nice way

# Write why you're about to be descriptive

Why you're looking at UDP only. Write "These are the important terms that we need to define to describe what our research will do."

# Clarify about packets

What do you need to know about packets?

# The data is encrypted. Why does this make it challenging?

Don't sneak in the challenges within the discussion. Have problem description all in one place, have all of the definitions in one place too.

# Write poster instead of research paper in the timeline

Change it later if needed.

# It wasn't clear at the time that you were going to predict QoE

Make it clearer
