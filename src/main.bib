    abstract  = {A growing concern within today's networking community is that with the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) techniques, a lack of access to real-world production networks is putting academic researchers at a significant disadvantage. Indeed, compared to a select few research groups in industry that can leverage access to their global-scale production networks in their data-driven efforts to develop and evaluate learning models, academic researchers not only struggle to get their hands on real-world data sets but find it almost impossible to adequately train and assess their learning models under realistic conditions.
                 In this paper, we argue that when appropriately instrumented and properly managed, enterprise networks in the form of university or campus networks can serve as real-world production networks and can, because of their ubiquity, help create a more level playing field for academic researchers. Their various limitations notwithstanding, as real-world production networks, such enterprise networks can (i) serve as unique sources for some of the rich data that will enable these researchers to influence or advance the current state-of-the-art in AI/ML for networking and (ii) also function as much-needed test beds where newly developed AI/ML-based tools can be evaluated or "road-tested" prior to their actual deployment in the production network. We discuss new research challenges that arise from this proposed dual role of campus networks and comment on the opportunities our proposal affords for both academic and industry researchers to benefit from the advantages and limitations of their respective production environments in their common quest to advance the development and evaluation of AI/ML-based tools to the point where they can be deployed in practice.},

    abstract   = {This whitepaper proposes OpenFlow: a way for researchers to run experimental protocols
                  in the networks they use every day. OpenFlow is based on an Ethernet switch, with
                  an internal flow-table, and a standardized interface to add and remove flow entries.
                  Our goal is to encourage networking vendors to add OpenFlow to their switch products
                  for deployment in college campus backbones and wiring closets. We believe that OpenFlow
                  is a pragmatic compromise: on one hand, it allows researchers to run experiments on
                  heterogeneous switches in a uniform way at line-rate and with high port-density; while
                  on the other hand, vendors do not need to expose the internal workings of their switches.
                  In addition to allowing researchers to evaluate their ideas in real-world traffic
                  settings, OpenFlow could serve as a useful campus component in proposed large-scale
                  testbeds like GENI. Two buildings at Stanford University will soon run OpenFlow networks,
                  using commercial Ethernet switches and routers. We will work to encourage deployment
                  at other schools; and We encourage you to consider deploying OpenFlow in your university
                  network too},

    abstract = {P4 is a high-level language for programming protocol-independent packet processors. P4 works in conjunction with SDN control protocols like OpenFlow. In its current form, OpenFlow explicitly specifies protocol headers on which it operates. This set has grown from 12 to 41 fields in a few years, increasing the complexity of the specification while still not providing the flexibility to add new headers. In this paper we propose P4 as a strawman proposal for how OpenFlow should evolve in the future. We have three goals: (1) Reconfigurability in the field: Programmers should be able to change the way switches process packets once they are deployed. (2) Protocol independence: Switches should not be tied to any specific network protocols. (3) Target independence: Programmers should be able to describe packet-processing functionality independently of the specifics of the underlying hardware. As an example, we describe how to use P4 to configure a switch to add a new hierarchical label.},
