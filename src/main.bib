    abstract  = {Video conferencing applications (VCAs) have become a critical Internet
                 application, even more so during the COVID-19 pandemic, as users worldwide now
                 rely on them for work, school, and telehealth. It is thus increasingly
                 important to understand the resource requirements of different VCAs and how
                 they perform under different network conditions, including: how much speed
                 (upstream and downstream throughput) a VCA needs to support high quality of
                 experience; how VCAs perform under temporary reductions in available capacity;
                 how they compete with themselves, with each other, and with other applications;
                 and how usage modality (e.g., number of participants) affects utilization. We
                 study three modern VCAs: Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. Answers to
                 these questions differ substantially depending on VCA. First, the average
                 utilization on an unconstrained link varies between 0.8 Mbps and 1.9 Mbps.
                 Given temporary reduction of capacity, some VCAs can take as long as 50 seconds
                 to recover to steady state. Differences in proprietary congestion control
                 algorithms also result in unfair bandwidth allocations: in constrained
                 bandwidth settings, one Zoom video conference can consume more than 75% of the
                 available bandwidth when competing with another VCA (e.g., Meet, Teams). For
                 some VCAs, client utilization can decrease as the number of participants
                 increases, due to the reduced video resolution of each participant's video
                 stream given a larger number of participants. Finally, one participant's
                 viewing mode (e.g., pinning a speaker) can affect the upstream utilization of
                 other participants.},

    abstract  = {In video streaming service, the user's Quality of Experience (QoE) is not only related to video signal quality received at consumer's devices, the users' subjectivity must also be considered. In this context, a video quality assessment method that takes into account the user's preference for video content is proposed in this research. In order to perform this task, the users' profiles that include their preferences were stored in a video server. Then, subjective tests of video quality assessment were conducted, in which evaluators had different video content preferences. Results show that the evaluators' QoE is highly correlated with the user's preference for video content type. Based on these experimental results, a function named Preference Factor (PF) is defined and used to adjust the quality index values obtained by an objective video quality metric running in the end user's device. The PF function also depends on video content type and quality index score. Using the PF function, the enhanced Video streaming Quality Metric (e-VsQM) is proposed and the results of its performance evaluation demonstrate that PF improves an objective video quality metric. Furthermore, e-VsQM has low complexity and can be utilized in different video services. Thus, an application scenario is presented, in which the proposed video quality metric is implemented.},
