    abstract  = {Video conferencing applications (VCAs) have become a critical Internet application, even more so during the COVID-19 pandemic, as users worldwide now rely on them for work, school, and telehealth. It is thus increasingly important to understand the resource requirements of different VCAs and how they perform under different network conditions, including: how much speed (upstream and downstream throughput) a VCA needs to support high quality of experience; how VCAs perform under temporary reductions in available capacity; how they compete with themselves, with each other, and with other applications; and how usage modality (e.g., number of participants) affects utilization. We study three modern VCAs: Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. Answers to these questions differ substantially depending on VCA. First, the average utilization on an unconstrained link varies between 0.8 Mbps and 1.9 Mbps. Given temporary reduction of capacity, some VCAs can take as long as 50 seconds to recover to steady state. Differences in proprietary congestion control algorithms also result in unfair bandwidth allocations: in constrained bandwidth settings, one Zoom video conference can consume more than 75\% of the available bandwidth when competing with another VCA (e.g., Meet, Teams). For some VCAs, client utilization can decrease as the number of participants increases, due to the reduced video resolution of each participant's video stream given a larger number of participants. Finally, one participant's viewing mode (e.g., pinning a speaker) can affect the upstream utilization of other participants.},

    abstract  = {In video streaming service, the user's Quality of Experience (QoE) is not only related to video signal quality received at consumer's devices, the users' subjectivity must also be considered. In this context, a video quality assessment method that takes into account the user's preference for video content is proposed in this research. In order to perform this task, the users' profiles that include their preferences were stored in a video server. Then, subjective tests of video quality assessment were conducted, in which evaluators had different video content preferences. Results show that the evaluators' QoE is highly correlated with the user's preference for video content type. Based on these experimental results, a function named Preference Factor (PF) is defined and used to adjust the quality index values obtained by an objective video quality metric running in the end user's device. The PF function also depends on video content type and quality index score. Using the PF function, the enhanced Video streaming Quality Metric (e-VsQM) is proposed and the results of its performance evaluation demonstrate that PF improves an objective video quality metric. Furthermore, e-VsQM has low complexity and can be utilized in different video services. Thus, an application scenario is presented, in which the proposed video quality metric is implemented.},

The performance counters from the technical equipment and results from the survey regarding students’ perceived experience, showed definite Quality of Service to Quality of Experience correlation. When network and application Quality of Service were considered complementary, students’ Quality of Experience was in average 18.5\% higher compared to network and 15\% to application Quality of Service implementations. Similarly, best technical performance was achieved when both mechanisms were consider as a whole, such as 34\% decrease in average transmit delay compared to application and 62.5\% to network Quality of Service mechanisms, etc. Finally, application controls had greater impact on perceived students’ Quality of Experience than the network ones, which correlated to performance behavior of the infrastructure.Videoconferencing technology is a successful tool for expanding possibilities for collaborative and distance learning, while bridging the distance between the teacher and students, providing time and cost savings.

In addition, AQoS controls had greater impact on perceived students’ QoE than NQoS.},

    abstract  = {The end users' satisfactory Quality of Experience (QoE) is a fundamental criterion for networked video service providers such as video-on-demand providers (Netflix, YouTube, etc.), cloud gaming providers (Google Stadia, PlayStation Now, etc.) and videoconferencing providers (Zoom, Microsoft Teams, etc.). To know the QoE, providers today typically predict it from the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters or the client-side's actual QoE metrics measured at the current time-step. But the former does not precisely reflect the users' experience, and the latter has a delay between QoE measurements at the client-side and the user's current experience. Mitigating this delay can provide a noticeable improvement in the delivery system's performance. For example, accurate forecasting of QoE for the near future allows the service management system to take a proactive approach and fix delivery issues before they become a noticeable problem at the end user, or at least reduce overall QoE degradation. QoE forecasting can also be used in rate adaptation in DASH or resource allocation in wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a method to prognosticate QoE metrics. Using data collected from an industry video streaming testbed for three different classes, we define a multivariate time series forecasting problem. We then model a hybrid state-of-the-art deep learning method, BiLSTM-CNN, to forecast the QoE metrics in advance. Evaluation of our proposed method compared to four other well-known ML models of Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long short-term memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed method.},

    abstract  = {Quality of experience (QoE) is the perceptual quality of service (QoS) from the users' perspective. For video service, the relationship between QoE and QoS (such as coding parameters and network statistics) is complicated because users' perceptual video quality is subjective and diversified in different environments. Traditionally, QoE is obtained from subjective test, where human viewers evaluate the quality of tested videos under a laboratory environment. To avoid high cost and offline nature of such tests, objective quality models are developed to predict QoE based on objective QoS parameters, but it is still an indirect way to estimate QoE. With the rising popularity of video streaming over the Internet, data-driven QoE analysis models have newly emerged due to availability of large-scale data. In this paper, we give a comprehensive survey of the evolution of video quality assessment methods, analyzing their characteristics, advantages, and drawbacks. We also introduce QoE-based video applications and, finally, identify the future research directions of QoE.},

    abstract  = {The motion-compensated hybrid DCT/DPCM algorithm has been successfully adopted in various video coding standards, such as H.261, H.263, MPEG-1 and MPEG-2. However, its robustness is challenged in the face of an inadequate bit allocation, either globally for the whole video sequence, or locally as a result of an inappropriate distribution of the available bits. In either of these situations, the trade-off between quality and the availability of bits results in a deterioration in the quality of the decoded video sequence, both in terms of the loss of information and the introduction of coding artifacts. These distortions are an important factor in the fields of filtering, codec design, and the search for objective psychovisual-based quality metrics; therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis and classification of the numerous coding artifacts which are introduced into the reconstructed video sequence through the use of the hybrid MC/DPCM/DCT video coding algorithm. Artifacts which have already been briefly described in the literature, such as the blocking effect, ringing, the mosquito effect, MC mismatch, blurring, and color bleeding, will be comprehensively analyzed. Additionally, we will present artifacts with unique properties which have not been previously identified in the literature.},
