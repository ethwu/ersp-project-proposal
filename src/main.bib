    abstract  = {Video conferencing applications (VCAs) have become a critical Internet application, even more so during the COVID-19 pandemic, as users worldwide now rely on them for work, school, and telehealth. It is thus increasingly important to understand the resource requirements of different VCAs and how they perform under different network conditions, including: how much speed (upstream and downstream throughput) a VCA needs to support high quality of experience; how VCAs perform under temporary reductions in available capacity; how they compete with themselves, with each other, and with other applications; and how usage modality (e.g., number of participants) affects utilization. We study three modern VCAs: Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. Answers to these questions differ substantially depending on VCA. First, the average utilization on an unconstrained link varies between 0.8 Mbps and 1.9 Mbps. Given temporary reduction of capacity, some VCAs can take as long as 50 seconds to recover to steady state. Differences in proprietary congestion control algorithms also result in unfair bandwidth allocations: in constrained bandwidth settings, one Zoom video conference can consume more than 75\% of the available bandwidth when competing with another VCA (e.g., Meet, Teams). For some VCAs, client utilization can decrease as the number of participants increases, due to the reduced video resolution of each participant's video stream given a larger number of participants. Finally, one participant's viewing mode (e.g., pinning a speaker) can affect the upstream utilization of other participants.},

    abstract  = {In video streaming service, the user's Quality of Experience (QoE) is not only related to video signal quality received at consumer's devices, the users' subjectivity must also be considered. In this context, a video quality assessment method that takes into account the user's preference for video content is proposed in this research. In order to perform this task, the users' profiles that include their preferences were stored in a video server. Then, subjective tests of video quality assessment were conducted, in which evaluators had different video content preferences. Results show that the evaluators' QoE is highly correlated with the user's preference for video content type. Based on these experimental results, a function named Preference Factor (PF) is defined and used to adjust the quality index values obtained by an objective video quality metric running in the end user's device. The PF function also depends on video content type and quality index score. Using the PF function, the enhanced Video streaming Quality Metric (e-VsQM) is proposed and the results of its performance evaluation demonstrate that PF improves an objective video quality metric. Furthermore, e-VsQM has low complexity and can be utilized in different video services. Thus, an application scenario is presented, in which the proposed video quality metric is implemented.},

    abstract  = {Videoconferencing technology is a successful tool for expanding possibilities for collaborative and distance learning, while bridging the distance between the teacher and students, providing time and cost savings. Recently, the focus in literature and practice for quality requirements are shifting from deterministic behavior of the infrastructure in videoconferencing learning environments to students’ Quality of Experience, as subjective measure that involves human dimensions. Hence, this study evaluates the impact of different Quality of Service mechanisms utilized in the infrastructure on students’ Quality of Experience in videoconferencing learning environments. It involved 263 faculty students that participated in 42 learning sessions via videoconferencing during their academic activities, while the infrastructure was subjected to Quality of Service mechanism in the network, as well as application enhancement in the videoconferencing platform, or both. The performance counters from the technical equipment and results from the survey regarding students’ perceived experience, showed definite Quality of Service to Quality of Experience correlation. When network and application Quality of Service were considered complementary, students’ Quality of Experience was in average 18.5\% higher compared to network and 15\% to application Quality of Service implementations. Similarly, best technical performance was achieved when both mechanisms were consider as a whole, such as 34\% decrease in average transmit delay compared to application and 62.5\% to network Quality of Service mechanisms, etc. Finally, application controls had greater impact on perceived students’ Quality of Experience than the network ones, which correlated to performance behavior of the infrastructure.Videoconferencing technology is a successful tool for expanding possibilities for collaborative and distance learning, while bridging the distance between the teacher and students, providing time and cost savings.

The performance counters from the technical equipment and results from the survey regarding students’ perceived QoE after each learning session, showed definite QoS/QoE correlation. Even though students’ were not aware of the technical setup during the learning sessions, the highest level of students’ QoE was achieved when NQoS and AQoS were considered complementary, rather than as a single mechanism. In addition, AQoS controls had greater impact on perceived students’ QoE than NQoS.},
