    abstract  = {A growing concern within today's networking community is that with the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) techniques, a lack of access to real-world production networks is putting academic researchers at a significant disadvantage. Indeed, compared to a select few research groups in industry that can leverage access to their global-scale production networks in their data-driven efforts to develop and evaluate learning models, academic researchers not only struggle to get their hands on real-world data sets but find it almost impossible to adequately train and assess their learning models under realistic conditions.
                 In this paper, we argue that when appropriately instrumented and properly managed, enterprise networks in the form of university or campus networks can serve as real-world production networks and can, because of their ubiquity, help create a more level playing field for academic researchers. Their various limitations notwithstanding, as real-world production networks, such enterprise networks can (i) serve as unique sources for some of the rich data that will enable these researchers to influence or advance the current state-of-the-art in AI/ML for networking and (ii) also function as much-needed test beds where newly developed AI/ML-based tools can be evaluated or "road-tested" prior to their actual deployment in the production network. We discuss new research challenges that arise from this proposed dual role of campus networks and comment on the opportunities our proposal affords for both academic and industry researchers to benefit from the advantages and limitations of their respective production environments in their common quest to advance the development and evaluation of AI/ML-based tools to the point where they can be deployed in practice.},

    abstract = {Many promising networking research ideas in programmable networks never see the light of day. Yet, deploying research prototypes in production networks can help validate research ideas, improve them with faster feedback, uncover new research questions, and also ease the subsequent transition to practice. In this paper, we show how researchers can run and validate their research ideas in their own backyards---on their production campus networks---and we have seen that such a demonstrator can expedite the deployment of a research idea in practice to solve real network operation problems. We present P4Campus , a proof-of-concept that encompasses tools, an infrastructure design, strategies, and best practices---both technical and non-technical---that can help researchers run experiments against their programmable network idea in their own network. We use network tapping devices, packet brokers, and commodity programmable switches to enable running experiments to evaluate research ideas on a production campus network. We present several compelling data-plane applications as use cases that run on our campus and solve production network problems. By sharing our experiences and open-sourcing our P4 apps [28], we hope to encourage similar efforts on other campuses.},
