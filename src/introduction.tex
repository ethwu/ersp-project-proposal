\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
    Data for networking research is currently largely in the hands of large corporations~\autocite{GuptaArpit2019AEtD}, a problem which may be solved through the use of data collection on campus networks. This use of campus networks for networking research has been done before; for example, at Princeton~University by~\textcite{KimHyojoon2021Erop}. The University of~California, Santa~Barbara Systems and Networking~Lab~(SNL) has been working on a similar project, using a network of Raspberry~Pi clones distributed around campus to test the performance of the campus network when streaming media.
