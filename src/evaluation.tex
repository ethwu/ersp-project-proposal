\section{Evaluation Plan}\label{evaluation}
    In order to evaluate our approach, we need to determine if we have collected enough and significant data that we can generalize our result to a greaeter scope. The first goal of our project is to ensure that we have reliable data that are significant enough for our research. By having a metric that keep track of the packet capture rate, we can imediately tell if there will be problems for the data we collected, when the capture rate drops.

    The most important goal is to determine how well the trends of QoE~data match with QoS~data. The way we determine this would be general statistics methods, which analyze the relationship and relatability. By generating plots and graphs, we should be able to view the result very clearly. 

    We hope that our project is reproducible. Everybody can collect their own QoS and QoE data, given our model of collecting those data, and use their own AI/ML training models to achieve a similar result while customized for thier own network environment.
