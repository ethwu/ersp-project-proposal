\section{Evaluation Plan}\label{evaluation}
    In order to evaluate our approach, we need to determine if we have collected enough and significant data that we can generalize our result to a greaeter scope. The first goal of our project, is to ensure that we have reliable data that are significant enough for our research. By having a metric that keep track of the packet capture rate, we can imediately tell if there will be problems for the data we collected, when the capture rate drops. 
    
    The second, yet, most important goal is to determine how well will the trends of QoE data match with QoS data. The way we determine this would be general statistics methods, which analyze the relationship and relatability. By generating plots and graphs, we should be able to view the result very clearly.
